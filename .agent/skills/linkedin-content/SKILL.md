# LinkedIn Content Creation Skill

This skill outlines the specific requirements, tone, and formatting for creating LinkedIn posts for this project.

## 1. Core Brand Identity
*   **Product Name**: Always refer to the project as **"LinkedIn Agent"** (formerly "Nexton").
*   **Perspective**: Always use the **First Person ("I", "My", "Me")**. Do not use "We" or "Our".
    *   *Correct*: "I recently updated my agent..."
    *   *Incorrect*: "We recently updated our agent..."
*   **Language**: Unless specified otherwise, **ALWAYS provide both English 🇬🇧 and Spanish 🇪🇸 versions** in the same document.

## 2. Tone & Style
*   **Professional yet Personal**: Share the *engineering journey*, not just the result.
*   **Transparent**: Admit challenges (e.g., "The black box problem", "The wall of text").
*   **Technical but Accessible**: Use technical terms (FastAPI, SSE, React) but explain *why* they matter to the UX.
*   **Hashtags**: Use relevant tags like `#FastAPI #React #AI #BuildInPublic #Engineering`.

## 3. Standard Format
When requested to write a post, structure the response as follows:

```markdown
# Draft: LinkedIn Announcement - [Topic]

[Optional: Context or Goal of the post]

---

## 🇬🇧 English Version

### Option 1: Storytelling / Journey (The "Why" and "How")
[A longer, narrative-driven post focusing on a problem and solution]

### Option 2: Feature Focus (The "What")
[A short, punchy post highlighting the new capability with bullet points]

## 🇪🇸 Versión en Español

## 4. Key Themes to Highlight
*   **"Building in Public"**: Sharing lessons learned.
*   **"Agentic AI"**: Moving beyond chatbots to autonomous agents.
*   **"UX for AI"**: Making AI processes visible and trustworthy (e.g., thinking states, rich streaming).
